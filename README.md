# About me.

Hello! I am Sam, a first year bachelor AI-student looking to learn more in the field of AI. I am a cinephile, avid enjoyer of R&B, hip-hop and alternative indie music and enjoy streetwear fashion. Additionally I practice the guitar; both electric and acoustic and occasionally play piano. I aspire to go hiking some day in the Pacific Northwest or the mountains of Scotland and become a digital nomad ;)
