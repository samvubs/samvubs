# About me.

Hello! I am Sam, a first-year undergraduate student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I am looking to deepen my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. Aside from academic pursuits, I am a passionate cinephile and audiophile; collecting records and playing guitar. I like creative expression and love to shoot analog film. I aspire to become a digital nomad hiking in the forests of Oregon ;)
